# MOSAIC: Multi-Obfuscated Spatial Association and Identity Concealment

## Project Overview

MOSAIC is a privacy-preserving geospatial coordination platform that enables users to broadcast location-derived context while maintaining plausible deniability through obfuscation, intermediary buffering, and consensual information degradation.

**Core Innovation**: Instead of hiding data through access control, MOSAIC buries true signals in computationally infeasible noise, making attribution probabilistically impossible rather than merely difficult.
